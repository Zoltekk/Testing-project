Write an automated test that will run on the website and login with different credentials.
Tests must be parameterized to check whether things work as they appear on successful and failed login attempts.
Do all possible combinations at your disposal: good username, bad username, good password, bad password.
You should also target illegal characters, blank form, too long password/username, etc.
